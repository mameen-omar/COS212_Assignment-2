	/*
	TODO: The DoubleThreadedAVL class inherits from the 
	DoubleThreadedBST class. A lot of the functionality 
	required for an AVL tree will be handled in your 
	DoubleThreadedBST class. You will have to override all 
	appropriate methods inherited from DoubleThreadedBST 
	in order to create a functional AVL tree.
	
	You must add any additional methods or data fields which 
	you might need to accomplish your task. After every 
	deletion or insertion the AVL tree has to be checked for
	balance, and if it is not balanced, the necessary rotations
	must be performed. Left and right threads must be updated
	accordingly.
	
	Note that you can add an extra field to the DTNode class to
	account for the AVL node balance factor.
	
	NOTE: DoubleThreadedBST implements delete by merging. AVL 
	trees use delete by copying. For your deletion, you must 
	use the mirror case of delete by copying as discussed in 
	the examples in the textbook. That is, you have to use the 
	immediate successor (as opposed to predecessor) of a node.
